# Librarian

This is a tiny command-line application to manage your digital library.

## Why?

I never found a satisfying way of storing and searching my digital library.
Using the documents' metadata sounded like a good idea, but then I realized that
editing the metadata of several file formats would require having more
than one application to do it. Then I wrote this small app to handle it instead.

## How?

- When you store a document using `lbr add`, the file is copied to the
  `~/.library` folder and the metadata is added to the index file. Each
  document is indexed using the hash of the file. Additionally you can provide
  the ISBN of the document if it has one and Librarian will try to recover its
  metadata from Open Library.

- Then you can search in your library using `lbr find`.

- Once you found the document, you can open it using `lbr open` with the
  document's hash. This is equivalent to using `open` or `xdg-open`.

- If you need to change the information of a document, use `lbr edit` to open
  the information as a JSON using your default text editor.

For more help, run `lbr help`.

## Installation

Clone this repository and run `cargo install --path <path-to-repo>`.

## Stability

The API of Librarian will be susceptible to change until it reaches version
`1.0.0`. However, I won't be changing the format of the index unless it is in a
backwards-compatible way. So if you want to play with it and give it a try, you
can rest assured that the next update of Librarian won't mess up your index.
